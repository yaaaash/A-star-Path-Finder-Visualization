# A-star-Path-Finder-Visualization
This project demonstrates my implementation of the A* algorithm in Python, which is widely used for efficient pathfinding in grid-based environments. With the help of pygame graphics, I have created a visually interactive application that allows users to define a start and end point and visually observe the algorithm finding the shortest path.
